        <h2>Our approach </h2>
        <p>Our approach is modeled around bringing change at all levels
            With your support, we address children’s critical needs by working with parents, teachers, Anganwadi workers, communities, district and state level governments as well as the children themselves.   We focus on changing behaviours and practices at the grassroots level and influencing public policy at a systemic level – thereby creating an ecosystem where children are made the nation’s priority.
